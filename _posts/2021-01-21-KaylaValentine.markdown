#Good Design – Putting the FUN in Functional

One of the most important takeaways from chapter one of Barnum’s Usability Testing Essentials is that usability should focus on the users rather than the product’s performance. The product that I chose, a ladle formed after a dinosaur, or perhaps the Loch Ness Monster (LNM), certainly has a niche audience; however, it is an innovative design that improves upon something mundane that everyone at least has in their kitchen, making it already at least partially successful in user satisfaction. While ordinary ladles are basically giant spoons that are deeply concaved, the LNM ladles feature small legs on the bottom so that the spoon can stand rather than sink into the pot, as well as a more hooked handle – fashioned to look like a head – to allow for both the fun look of the LNM swimming in your soups and sauces, and the functional effect of being hangable should the user choose to do so. That being said, looking through buyer reviews (an arguably modern version of usability testing) it appears that the ladles are made with cheap materials, making these unique, innovative designs nearly useless. Therefore, though the design is good, the execution was poor, causing user dissatisfaction that could be remedied by using the results inadvertently garnered from their audience.
