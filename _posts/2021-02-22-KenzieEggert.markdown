#Mr. Yuck

As someone who is particularly interested in User Experience, I oftentimes find myself noticing designs that could be considered poor. 
However, being able to identify good designs becomes equally important. I feel that the Mr. Yuk sticker can be considered a good design. 
I can remember identifying this sticker at a young age, and while I have not seen one in the last few years, they are in fact still being produced. 
I have included a link to a photo of the classic sticker. I feel that there are a few characteristics that definitely pull this product to the “good” side of design. 
When looking at the sticker, you cannot help but notice the striking bright green color. Also taking notice of the common facial expression on the sticker which is typically 
associated with a facial expression one would make when something is “yucky”. I also find the fact that both the word “Poison” and a phone number for the 
Poison Control Center being included is extremely useful to take action if necessary. This sticker ties together the concept of “yucky” poisons for anyone who may 
encounter it that can “stick” with us in our minds and be identifiable. In this instance, a sticker is something simple, but yet effective.
